The goal is make the UAV to fly with a planning trajectory, meanwhile, via the point which we have set before with a smooth trajectory.

The first is: choose the points in rviz, end the choose process with a point which axis-z down to zero, the UVA fly with the planning trajectory in gazebo. The planning trajectory and the UVA via trajectory are showed in rviz.
